Welcome to my portfolio repository! This space showcases some of the projects I’ve built while learning and growing as a web developer. It's a reflection of my journey, skills, and progress in web development.
About Me:
I’m a front-end web developer in formation focused on creating responsive, accessible, and user-friendly websites and applications. I'm currently sharpening my skills in:
HTML5
CSS3
JavaScript (ES6+)
Responsive Design
Version Control with Git & GitHub

📁 What's Inside:
This portfolio includes:
✅ Mini projects and practice challenges
🎨 UI designs turned into functional web pages
💻 Real-world inspired web apps
📄 Code snippets and reusable components
Each project is organized in its own folder with a README.md explaining what it does, what I learned, and how to run it.
You can explore the folders to see individual projects. Many of them include:
Screenshots or demos
Instructions on how to view/run the project locally
